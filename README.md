username
========

Live username availability check while you type. When there is a pause of 500 milliseconds the username will be checked against the database. 
The username choice will be reserved temporarily for 6 minutes, temporary blocking the username from other users. 
If the username is not selected, it will be freed for others to reserve.

This example is using jQuery, PHP Data Objects and MySQL, of course you can use a different database if you wish.
